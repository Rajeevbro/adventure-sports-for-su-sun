# Adventure Sports
According to [wikipidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_sport), adventure sports are the activities perceived as involving a high degree of risk. These activities often involve speed, height, a high level of physical exertion and highly specialized gear. I am a adventur junki. I love it when I get to experience the emotion of intense thrill. These sports have high risks but still I choose to experience them for the adrenaline rush that I get.

## My Experience with adventure sports
- **Rafting**

In 2016 I had a chance to do white water rafting in the [Trisuli river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trishuli_River) in Nepal. It was the river with grade 2-3 rapids. In future I want to do more white water rafting in rivers with grade 4-5 rapids. 

- **Parasailing**

In 2014, I did Parasailing at Pataya, Thailand. I felt a good adrinaline rush when I was pulled by a boat and I was flying in the sky with the parachute.

- **Mountain Biking**

I grew up in Kathmandu valley which is surrounded by many hills where mountain biking is very popular. I have been to man mountain biking trips around the hills of Kathmandu valley. I really enjoy going down hills on off road tracks.
